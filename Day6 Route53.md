# Route53
# Why we need Route53?
- Route53 is used for DNS(Domain Name System) as a service in AWS.
- EC2-> compute as a service, EKS -> Elastic Kubernetes as a Service similiarly DNS purpose we use Route53.
- Example amazon.com or flipkart.com domain name is mapped to some ip address for simplifying the access to applications.
- For this domain name conversion to IP address we need a service called Route53 in AWS.
