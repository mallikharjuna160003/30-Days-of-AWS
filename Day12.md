# How CodeCommit works?
CodeCommit is familiar to users of Git-based repositories, but even those unfamiliar should find the transition to CodeCommit relatively simple. CodeCommit provides a console for the easy creation of repositories and the listing of existing repositories and branches. In a few simple steps, users can find information about a repository and clone it to their computer, creating a local repo where they can make changes and then push them to the CodeCommit repository. Users can work from the command line on their local machines or use a GUI-based editor.
